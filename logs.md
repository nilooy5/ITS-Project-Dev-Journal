# Weekly Journal

## Week 1

Not much progress this week. We got to look at the brief intro to the project and voted the project that had good social impact. We went with the one with WIC as a sponsor. We had a internal team meeting and decided to go with the project. We did not have a meeting with the sponsor this week. Hope to have one next week. I wanted to work on a different project which is basically building a modern UI for a EV charging station management system which should have been a really good project since it had frontend work with some data analysis and data visualization. It would have been easier for me to work on that project. But since everyone voted for the WIC project thinking that the EV one is going to be the tough one, I have no other choice but to work on that project.

## Week 2

 New details were added to the project description in the canvas website. It turned out a bit different that what I expected the project to be. It looks like a challenging project. I am a bit worried about the time constraint. I hope we can finish the project on time. There are few bottlenecks in this project that I have discovered and was added to the description which were not there when they were proposed in the list.

 1. It was told that we have to build a membership management system but it looks like we have to create a product that has to do with subscription (this is my inital guess).
 2. We have to integrate with some third party API which is not clear yet. One of them is going to be a payment API. Should take a bit time if not everyone is familiar with it.
 3. Our sponsors want us to work with a wordpress plugin and want us to integrate that to the system we build. Not sure how that is going to work. I am not familiar with wordpress plugin development.

 However, we had a meeting on the weekends and discussed about the challanges and the project. We decided to go with the project. We are going to have a meeting with the sponsor on Monday. I hope we can get some more details about the project.
