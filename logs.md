# Weekly Journal

## Week 1

Not much progress this week. We got to look at the brief intro to the project and voted the project that had good social impact. We went with the one with WIC as a sponsor. We had a internal team meeting and decided to go with the project. We did not have a meeting with the sponsor this week. Hope to have one next week. I wanted to work on a different project which is basically building a modern UI for a EV charging station management system which should have been a really good project since it had frontend work with some data analysis and data visualization. It would have been easier for me to work on that project. But since everyone voted for the WIC project thinking that the EV one is going to be the tough one, I have no other choice but to work on that project.

## Week 2

 New details were added to the project description in the canvas website. It turned out a bit different that what I expected the project to be. It looks like a challenging project. I am a bit worried about the time constraint. I hope we can finish the project on time. There are few bottlenecks in this project that I have discovered and was added to the description which were not there when they were proposed in the list.

 1. It was told that we have to build a membership management system but it looks like we have to create a product that has to do with subscription (this is my inital guess).
 2. We have to integrate with some third party API which is not clear yet. One of them is going to be a payment API. Should take a bit time if not everyone is familiar with it.
 3. Our sponsors want us to work with a wordpress plugin and want us to integrate that to the system we build. Not sure how that is going to work. I am not familiar with wordpress plugin development.

 However, we had a meeting on the weekends and discussed about the challanges and the project. We decided to go with the project. We are going to have a meeting with the sponsor on Monday. I hope we can get some more details about the project.

## Week 3

The meeting with the sponsor was not very productive. We did not get much details about the project. There were some things that I was concerned about which the sponsor was also not sure about. These are the things I got from our sponsors.

1. The WIC have a premium membership management system. The members get subsciption emails from a third party service called "Mailchamp". The payment system used by the organization is WooCommerce which is basically a wordpress plugin. **_The real catch is they maintain this list using a excel sheet._**
2. The sponsor said that they do not have access to their front-end website which was developed and still being maintained by a Phillipine based company. Their only contact for this website in that company has left the company and they do not have any contact anymore.
3. When I asked them if they want us to build a system (a full-stack application) to maintain their membership list, they clearly said "No".
4. Since they maintain the subscription list using a excel sheet manually, the list has a lot of incorrect data. For example, people who have unsubscribed are still in the list. So they are still getting emails from the third party service Mailchamp. They want us to fix this issue.

Upon finishing the meeting, I had a feeling that the sponsors are not sure what they want and they told us that they are keeping the problem open ended. My solution to this project was to make a new register portal so that the new customers are tracked through a backend and previous data are also migrated rather using a excel sheet. Since, I had the experience in building a full-stack application, I decided to go with the project. We are going to have a meeting with the sponsor on Monday. I hope we can get some more details about the project.

The next day some of our team members were feeling that this project was not for our team since we come from Data Science background and I felt really worried about it since it is already week 3. I let them discuss about what they want to do, because I do not want a team where half of the members are uncomfortable with the project.

After a long discussion and extensive exchange of emails between our team and the university, we were assigned a new project. I am now happy that everyone is feeling comfortable with the project since it is related to Data Science. We had a meeting with our new sponsor and she was to the point and gave us a clear idea about the project. We had a meeting after that and made a draft of the topics of the project and the tasks that we have to do.
